# benchmarking_nd4j
Simple Microbenchmarks for ND4J utilizing the JMH

## Building

   mvn clean package

## Running

  java -jar target/benchmarks.jar


For a quick run, e.g. just the same Matrix Size progression as used in the Neanderthal benchmarks, run like this:

   java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -f2 -i10 -wi 2 Neanderthal

## Choosing a BLAS Library

Since ND4J supports multiple blas libraries, you have to specify which one you actually want to use. For my own benchmarks I've been using MKL.
